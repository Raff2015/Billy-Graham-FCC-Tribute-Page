            the airport driving his own car.
            When we approached his home, I thought he would live on a thousand-acre farm, and we drove up to this house
            made of logs.<mark>No mansion with crystal
              chandeliers and gold carpets, it was the kind of a house a man of God would live in. I look up to him.<b>“</b></mark></p>
